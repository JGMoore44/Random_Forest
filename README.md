# Random_Forrest
This Repository Contains Example Work with Random Forests

Workflow:

1) We start with a basic CART model to show the foundation of random forests.

2) We next move to a completely un-tuned random forest to show the superiority of ensamble methods.

3) Finally we generate a tuned random forest to achieve prediction at optimal performance.
